% Make dragging nodes more efficient by using separate layers to render
% the dragged objects during the operation

There are a few opportunities for improvement in \keggapp. The most immediate is
in rendering efficiency. The multitude of graphical objects consumes more memory
than necessary and causes slowness when moving the graph around in the scroll
view. This could be improved by optimizing the rendering code.

A more visible improvement would be the inclusion of more data from KEGG in the
visualization and sidebar. The button to show the KEGG web page is helpful, but
much of that information is available through KEGG web services. There are also
other sources for information such as graphical depictions of molecules which
would be very helpful to have in the sidebar to show when a metabolite is
selected.

The implementation of built-in \pathcasekegg database queries is in progress.
For example, the query ``Pathways that are significantly enriched with a
user-provided set of genes'' now has a web service to return results, but the
iPad interface has not yet been implemented. In the future, as many of these
queries as possible will be implemented.
