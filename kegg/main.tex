Unlike PathCase MAW, The PathCase KEGG database is intended more for students
and instructors than for researchers. It is updated each year from the official
KEGG database \cite{pathcase-basic}.

The iPad app for PathCase KEGG, \keggapp, is totally separate from the MAW
version. It uses a newer Cocoa API, newer language features of Objective-C, and
has different software architecture.
