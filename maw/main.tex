The Metabolomics Analysis Workbench is designed for metabolomics analysis.
PathCaseMAW database contains a fully hierarchically compartmentalized metabolic
network for humans and mice. Full compartment hierarchy refers to the
multi-tissue (e.g.  liver, adipose tissue, muscle, etc) environment as well as a
complete biological compartment distinction (e.g., liver-cell, liver-cytosol,
liver-mitochondrion, etc.).

\section{Browsing Pathways}

The iPad application displays metabolic pathway graphs for all pathways for
which PathCase provides a static layout. These graphs can be navigated by
panning and zooming.
