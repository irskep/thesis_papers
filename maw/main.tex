The MAW app is split into two major components. The first is a pathway browser
that adds tissue and compartment information to the individual pathways. The
second is a touch-based implementation of the SMDA (Steady-State Metabolic
Network Dynamics Analysis) tool.

\section{Pathway Browser}

The iPad application displays metabolic pathway graphs for all pathways for
which PathCase provides a static layout. These graphs can be navigated by
panning and zooming.
