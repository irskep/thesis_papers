The literature I have found falls into two major categories. The first
category is general multitouch interface research. Not much of the general
multitouch research seems to apply, since iOS already has a standard interface
and guidelines for implementing new interfaces. All custom interactions happen
within the graph view. However, some relevant research is presented here for
completeness.

A few papers present taxonomies of gestures. Frisch et al provide one example
\cite{multitouch:gestures}. (I am looking for more.)

Others offer new interfaces to help bridge the divide between multitouch input
devices and the pre-iPad desktop interfaces. In this vein, Benko et al describe
a new interface to help a user select very small pointing targets
\cite{multitouch:tiny-select}. However, modern touch interfaces circumvent this
issue by not requiring users to select unreasonably tiny targets in the first
place.

The second category is graph interface research. Kobourov et al have a
multi-touch interface for making pairs of graphs with similarly placed nodes
\cite{graph-interaction:simultaneousgraphdrawing}, which will likely be useful
in the SMDA application. I have found one paper in which the researchers use
bubbles along the edges of the screen to represent offscreen nodes (but I am so
far unable to download it).

There is a lot of talk about UML, but it is not relevant to this application.
Another paper uses a hybrid graphical and text interface to explore graphs, but
text interfaces do not work well on touch-based devices.
