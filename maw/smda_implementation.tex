\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sect:smda_implementation}

Since SMDA uses the MAW data model, it shares all model classes, with a couple
of additions. There is an \texttt{SMDASavedMeasurement} class for storing the
user's selections. There is also a subclass of \texttt{PCGraphModel} called
\texttt{SMDAResultGraphModel} which provides methods to build a model out of XML
from the web service.

The remaining classes manage the user interface. They are basic subclasses of
Cocoa objects that implement standard design patterns for iOS applications to
display the interface shown in the screenshots in section
\ref{sect:smda_interface}.
