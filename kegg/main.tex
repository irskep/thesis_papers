Unlike PathCase MAW, The PathCase KEGG database is intended more for students
and instructors than for researchers. It is updated each year from the official
KEGG database \cite{pathcase-basic}.

The iPad app for PathCase KEGG is totally separate from the MAW version. It uses
a newer Cocoa API, newer language features of Objective-C, and has better
software architecture.
