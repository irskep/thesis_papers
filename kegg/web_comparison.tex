\subsection{Features}
\label{sect:kegg_comparison_features}

Table \ref{fig:kegg_comparison_table} shows a comparison of relevant features
from the online and iPad versions of the \pathcasekegg analysis tools. The
similarities and differences are elaborated here.

(Just kidding, not yet!)

\subsection{Performance}
\label{sect:kegg_comparison_performance}

The iPad version is orders of magnitude faster than the web version. Soon I will
have numbers to support this assertion.
