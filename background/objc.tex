\section{Objective-C, iOS, and Cocoa}
\label{sect:objc}

iPathCase is implemented using the Objective-C programming language and the
Cocoa application framework runnong on the iOS operating system. This section
describes each of these components and how they relate to iPathCase.

\subsection{The Objective-C Programming Language}
\label{sect:objc_objc}

\begin{quote}

    The Objective-C language is a simple computer language designed to enable
    sophisticated object-oriented programming. Objective-C is defined as a small
    but powerful set of extensions to the standard ANSI C language. Its
    additions to C are mostly based on Smalltalk, one of the first
    object-oriented programming languages. Objective-C is designed to give C
    full object-oriented programming capabilities, and to do so in a simple and
    straightforward way.

Objective-C is similar in some ways to other object-oriented languages like Java
and C++ in that it has classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces
(called protocols in Objective-C). Most of its differences arise from its
Smalltalk origins and its intentional compatibility with regular C code.

Objective-C is a dynamic programming language: types and methods are determined
(and changed) at runtime. Its dynamic behavior is handled by the \emph{runtime
library}, which is a C library that operates on the language's underlying
primitives to achive dynamic behavior. These primitives, including classes and
objects, are represented as C structs, unions, arrays, etc. under the hood,
allowing programmers to mix performance-sensitive low-level code with readable,
high-level code.

\subsubsection{Messages}
\label{sect:objc_messages}

Rather than accessing an object's methods by function
calls bound at compile time, Objective-C uses \emph{message passing}, in which
the target of a message is determined at runtime.

Message syntax differs from traditional function syntax in that each parameter
is both position-dependent (like C) \emph{and named}. These are all valid
messages:

\begin{verbatim}
// Definitions in Rectangle class
- (float)size;
- (void)setOriginX:(float)x y:(float)y;

// Message without arguments
float width = [myRectangle width];
// Message with arguments, one derived from a C function
[myRectangle setOriginWithX:sinf(10.0f) y:20.0f];
\end{verbatim}

However, this would not be valid:

\begin{verbatim}
[myRectangle y:20.0f setOriginWithX:10.0f];
\end{verbatim}

Other than these important differences, Objective-C may be understood to behave
like other object-oriented languages such as C++ with respect to its type
system, albeit with different syntax and terminology.
