\section{Implementation}
\label{sect:kegg_implementation}

The implementations for the MAW and KEGG apps are very similar, but they have
some important differences.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The KEGG application was written later and requires iOS 5, using many
    new features to achieve similar functionality with much less code.

    \item All web service requests are encapsulated in classes that
    asynchronously make the request, cache the response, interpret the XML,
    create the required data objects, and notify the rest of the app that the
    request is complete. This is in contrast to the MAW app strategy of
    downloading all data in one batch, converting it into Objective-C objects,
    and serializing those objects for later access.

    \item The ENZYME database is read from a SQLite file bundled with the app.
    The SQLite file is created by a Python script that converts the text format
    of the database into SQLite for more efficient access.

\end{enumerate}
