\subsection{Detailed Description}
Load a set of \char`\"{}beautified\char`\"{} pathways and mark them in Core Data. 

This used to be a web service, but now loads a static XML file from the application data. This is because all web services now have frozen layouts, but most of those frozen layouts are generated by an algorithm and unedited. The static file contains the ones that were edited by hand when the application was last updated. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
