Systems of interacting proteins form the basis for nearly every process of
living things, from moving around and digesting food to thinking and
reproducing. Somewhat surprisingly, a large proportion of the chemical processes
that underlie all of these activities are shared across a very wide range of
organisms. These shared processes are collectively referred to as
\emph{intermediary metabolism}. These include the \emph{catabolic} processes for
breaking down proteins, fats and carbohydrates (such as those found in food) and
the \emph{anabolic} processes for building new materials. Similar collections of
reactions that are more specialized to particular organisms are called
\emph{secondary metabolism}. The substances that these reactions produce and
consume are called \emph{metabolites}.

The biochemical processes in intermediary metabolism are almost all
\emph{catalyzed reactions}. That is, these reactions would barely take place at
all at normal temperatures and pressures; they require special compounds that
facilitate the reaction --- these compounds are called \emph{catalysts} or
\emph{enzymes}. (It is only partially in jest that many biochemistry courses
open with the professor saying that the reactions that take place in living
systems are ones you were taught were impossible in organic chemistry.)
Catalysts are usually named after the reaction they facilitate, usually with the
added suffix \emph{-ase}. For example, alcohol dehydrogenase is the enzyme that
turns ethyl alcohol into acetaldehyde by removing two hydrogen atoms. Common
classes of enzymes include dehydrogenases, synthetases, proteases (for breaking
down proteins), decarboxylases (removing carbon atoms), transferases (moving a
chemical group from one place to another), kinases, phosphatases (adding or
removing phosphate groups, respectively) and so on. The materials transformed by
catalysts are called \emph{substrates}. Unlike the substrates, catalysts
themselves are not changed by the reactions they participate in. A final point
to note about enzymatic reactions is that in many cases the reactions can
proceed in either direction. That is, and enzyme that transforms substance A
into substance B can often also facilitate the transformation of B into A. The
direction of the transformation depends on the concentrations of the substrates
and on the energetics of the reaction.

Even the basic transformations of intermediary metabolism can involve dozens or
hundreds of catalyzed reactions. These combinations of reactions, which
accomplish tasks like turning foods into useable energy or compounds are called
metabolic \emph{pathways}. Because of the many steps in these pathways and the
widespread presence of direct and indirect feedback loops, they can exhibit many
counterintuitive behaviors. Also, all of these chemical reactions are going on
in parallel.

In addition to the feedback loops among the substrates in the pathways, the
presence or absence of substrates can affect the behavior of the enzymes
themselves, through what is called \emph{allosteric} regulation. These
interactions occur when a substance binds to an enzyme someplace other than its
usual active site (the atoms in the molecule that have the enzymatic effect).
Binding at this other site changes the shape of the enzyme, thereby changing its
activity. Another method of controlling enzymes is called \emph{competitive
inhibition}. In this form of regulation, substance other than the usual
substrate of the enzyme binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing it
from having an effect on its substrate.

These are the basic mechanisms underlying eucaryotic cells, and much of this
applies to bacterial and archaeal ones as well.
