\begin{itemize}

    \item Allow refreshing cache (or refresh on every request in the background
        regardless of cache hit)

    \item Query KEGG for more data (?)

    \item Implement and write about PathCase KEGG queries on the iPad

    \item Make dragging nodes more efficient by using separate layers to render
        the dragged objects during the operation

\end{itemize}
