    Abstract

    by

    STEPHEN ROBERT JOHNSON
\end{center}

PathCase is a system designed to provide life scientists with an integrated
environment to study pathways, regardless of the source producing the
corresponding data. It includes databases for different pathway data sources,
web interfaces for viewing the information in the databases, tools for analyzing
the data, and web services to access the data programmatically.

This thesis describes the design and implementation of new touch screen-based
tools to view and analyze the data in the \pathcasekegg and \pathcasemaw
databases. The first tool, \mawapp, provides compartment-aware pathway
visualizations and access to the Steady-State Metabolic Network Dynamics
Analysis tool. The second tool, \keggapp, provides visualizations of KEGG
pathways, including relevant information from other data sources outside of
\pathcasekegg and KEGG.
