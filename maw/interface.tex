The home screen of the MAW app displays a list of pathways that the user can
choose from to view a graph. This screen is shown in figure
\ref{fig:maw_screenshot_list}. It also contains a brief explanation of the
PathCase database and instructions for using the app.

After selecting a pathway, the user enters the graph view, where they can pan
and zoom across a pathway. The view for glycolysis is shown in figure
\ref{fig:maw_screenshot_pathway}.
