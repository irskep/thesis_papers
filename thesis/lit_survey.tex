\section{Literature Survey}

(No citations because I am still tracking down various corrupted papers.)

The literature I have found falls into three major categories. The first category is general multitouch interface research. There are taxonomies of gestures \cite{multitouch:gestures} and descriptions of other multitouch interfaces. Not much of it seems to apply, since iOS already has a standard interface. All custom interactions happen within the graph view.

The second category is graph interface research. So far I have only found one interesting paper in which the researchers use bubbles along the edges of the screen to represent offscreen nodes. There is a lot of talk about UML, but it is not relevant to this application. One paper uses a hybrid graphical and text interface to explore graphs, but text interfaces do not work well on touch-based devices. There may be more relevant papers in this area, but I am still sifting through them.

The third category is graph theory. In particular, I am interested in graph rewriting, i.e. turning one graph into another based on rules. I found a good starting paper, but the version I have is corrupted. There are also many papers on graph query languages.

I am still looking for papers at the intersection between graph query languages, graph rewriting, and multitouch interfaces. For example, how can a user express a similarity query without entering any text? Or, how to easily select graphs that match a pattern?
